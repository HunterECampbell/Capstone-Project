### **The Problem That Needs to be Solved**

Is there a relationship between specific Pokémon sightings on *Pokémon GO* and the user's location? If so, can we predict what Pokémon will be sighted most often depending on the location of the *Pokémon GO* user?

<br>

### **The Client**

The client for this project is anyone who uses *Pokémon GO*. How interesting would it be to know that, "If I am by water, I could find a Lapras"? Or, "I know I have a better chance of finding a Dragonite at this location verses another location". Another practical use is farming Pokémon. If a client is looking for a ton of Abra to be able to train the most powerful Alakazam possible, where could Abra most commonly be found? Groups or individual clients would then have the ability and knowledge to go to the Pokémon's location, rather than randomly guessing where each Pokémon would be. There is a greater efficiency knowing the probability is higher in certain areas for certain types of Pokémon.

### **The Data to Use**

I will be using the data set from: [Predict'em All](https://www.kaggle.com/semioniy/predictemall)

<br>

### **My Approach to Solving the Problem**

I will first try linear regression to see if there is a common relationship between location and type of Pokémon. If not, perhaps some bar graphs and/or histograms will shed some light on the data set.

### **My Deliverables**

Code and graphs will be included in the final production of my Capstone Project. It will also come in the form of a slide deck.
